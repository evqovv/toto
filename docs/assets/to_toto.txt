You are the one I've been looking for, toto.
My heart is, and always will be, yours.
No matter what happened, I'm always proud of you, toto.
You are the most beautiful Jordanian girl I've ever seen, and in your eyes I see the most brightest stars.
You are always the brightest star in my eyes.
You complete me.
I'm so lucky to have you.
You're my everything.
All of me loves all of you.
To the world you are one person, but to me you are my whole world.
We are right for each other, just like God's artwork.
In your smile, I see something more beautiful than the stars.
We fit together like puzzle pieces.
Your soul shines like a thousand galaxies.
You are the melody that colors my silence.
If I could be with you for only three days, I wish it would be yesterday, today, and tomorrow.
Side by side or miles apart, you're forever in my heart.
I get lost in your eyes, and I never want to find my way out.
I'm addicted to you.
I choose you. And I'll choose you over and over and over. Without pause, without a doubt, in a heartbeat. I'll keep choosing you.
I loved you in this way: like a fire feeds on oxygen, simply, necessarily.
In a sea of people, my eyes will always search for you.
My love for you is as deep and endless as the ocean.
You should be kissed and often, and by someone who knows how.
I love you so much, toto.
I know you are smart, toto, so it doesn't mean much that you occasionally had bad marks.
I hope you will become more and more resilient and I will be with you.
I wish in my future when I wake up my first glance is you.
Be happy, toto, life is simple.
I wanna kiss you everywhere, toto.
I wanna hug you tightly, toto.
